# question 1 

    In this case the variable x is declared in the interface. So Interface attributes are by default public, static and final. 

# question 2

    There is no differences between these approaches. Because Interface methods are by default abstract and public.

# question 3

    The value of variable x is cannot be changed. Interface's variables are constant. Constant variables in interfaces are implicitly final, which means their values cannot be modified once assigned
